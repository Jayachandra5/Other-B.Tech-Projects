# Projects Completed During B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering

## Project 1: Solving the 8 Puzzle Problem using AI

## Project 2: Spam Mail Detection Model

### Description:
A model for classifying emails as spam or not spam, trained using the Random Forest algorithm. The model achieved the following accuracies:

- Accuracy with Binary Bag-of-Words (BoWs): 0.9807
- Accuracy with TF-IDF BoWs: 0.9824
- Accuracy with TF-IDF weighted average of word vectors: 0.9841
- Accuracy with Doc2Vec: 0.9179

## Project 3: Relationship between Chemical Similarity and Therapeutic Equivalence

### Abstract:
This project utilizes word embeddings to convert medication chemical structures into numerical vectors. By employing the DBSCAN algorithm for density-based clustering, it identifies therapeutically equivalent medications based on chemical composition similarity. The approach combines chemical and therapeutic knowledge, resulting in an efficient method for expanding equivalence mapping and enhancing medication substitution recommendations.
